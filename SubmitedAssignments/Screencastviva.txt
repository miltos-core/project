For F.2 (Screencast) and F.3 (Viva), here’s how you can run and demonstrate the required features:

F.2 Screencast

Open a terminal in your project directory.
Run the demo for BST/AVL (insertion, deletion, traversals):
This will show insert/delete operations and all three traversals.
Run the CLI for genealogy relations:
Example direct relation: "Αυγουστίνος Καποδίστριας" "Ιωάννης Καποδίστριας"
Example cousin: "Ιωάννης Καποδίστριας" "Ελένη Καποδίστρια"
Example unrelated: "Αυγουστίνος Καποδίστριας" "Κάποιος Άγνωστος"
Show persons.csv loading and output.
F.3 Viva

Be ready to run:
changeKey, insert, delete (use MainDemo or write a quick CLI).
relation queries as above.
Prepare to answer complexity questions:
AVL operations: 
O
(
log
⁡
n
)
O(logn) for insert/delete/search.
Explain why AVL is chosen (balance, performance).
Discuss implementation choices (maps for fast lookup, error handling, etc).
Tip: Record your screen while running these commands and explaining the output for F.2. For F.3, practice running commands and answering questions out loud.

Let me know if you want a script or more detailed step-by-step for the screencast or viva!







To demonstrate F.2 (Screencast) and F.3 (Viva) from NetBeans:

1. Run MainDemo (BST/AVL demo):

Right-click MainDemo.java in the Projects pane.
Select "Run File" to show insertions, deletions, and traversals.
2. Run GenealogyCLI (relation queries):

Right-click GenealogyCLI.java.
Select "Run File".
In the "Run" configuration, set the arguments (e.g., "Αυγουστίνος Καποδίστριας" "Ιωάννης Καποδίστριας").
Run to see the relation output.
3. Run Unit Tests:

Right-click the tests folder or any test class.
Select "Test" or "Run Tests" to execute all JUnit tests.
4. Show persons.csv loading:

Run GenealogyCLI.java or PersonRepositoryTest.java to show loading and output in the console.
5. For Viva (changeKey, insert/delete, relation):

Use MainDemo.java for tree operations.
Use GenealogyCLI.java for relation queries.
You can edit arguments and rerun as needed.
Tip: Use NetBeans' built-in screen recorder or any external tool to record your screencast while performing these actions.
